## Dev

Yarn tasks you can use:

- `yarn start`: For daily local development
- `yarn dev`: Same as `yarn start`
- `yarn debug`: Similar as `yarn start`, a little slower then `yarn start` but has more accurate sourcemap and compatible styles
- `yarn build`: For production build
- `yarn lint`: Lint and format all source files
